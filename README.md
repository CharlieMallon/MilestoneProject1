-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours are blue and white, these were chosen as they tie into the company logo.  Yellow has been used for the alerts due its contrasting nature.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Open Sans and Roboto are the two main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
        -   I chose these fonts because clear and simple fonts are deemed more trustworthy by the reader [view](https://www.snapagency.com/persuasive-typography-what-font-trustworthy/).
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
        -   The images have been used to break up the page and give the site a clean look.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)
    -   Error -  An img element must have an alt attribute, except under certain conditions. For details, consult guidance on providing text alternatives for images. (for three imgs)
        -   Fixed - reviewer images given alt tag.
    -   Warning -  Conciser using the h1 element as a top-level heading only (all h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools)
        -   Not corrected - The h1 is the top level heading and is only used once.  The warning is due to the h1 being wrapped in div's to allow it to 'float' on top of the Hero image.
    -   Warning -  Section lacks heading. Conciser using h2-h6 elements to add identifying heading to all sections.
        -   Not corrected - The section heading is a h1.  The warning is due to the h1 being wrapped in div's to allow it to 'float' on top of the Hero image.

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone11, & iPad.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
    -   The error's observed were grammatical. These errors have been corrected.
