                    <p> Originating from and predominantly living and working in the beautiful Lake District, UK. However, I have been lucky enough for my work to take me all over the world, sometimes for months at a time. 
                        Growing up watching my parents run multiple businesses instilled a strong work ethic and drive to succeed from a young age. This carried through into my work life. I really enjoy work so much so I kept taking on more – for a whole year I had 6 different jobs! 
                        When I found myself working every hour available in a career I enjoyed, With responsibility came the expectations, harder to switch off, loss of confidence and eventually anxiety.  Days off used to terrify me – what do people do with them? This started to seep into my work and removed all the enjoyment and no time to see friends, family and just have a life! From the outside I was still successful, I just no longer felt it. 
                        Then, It all came crashing down around me. I realised I had to change some things.
                        Consequently I developed boundaries, confidence, stamina and a healthier, stronger mindset to rediscover the joy in life without compromising my work. I achieve everything in work that I want to plus have time for the people and activities that make me happy. I have learnt that all of this can be achieved as well as letting your body rest and recover.
